# Project_Organizing
Organizing the projects and techniques I've been working on so far.


[C++]
- 2D / 3D Image Processing & Feature Recognition
- OpenCV

1. Preprocessing
   - Blurring, Filtering, Interpolation, Normalizing, Thresholding, ...

2. OCV
   - Image matching method focusing on the area where the feature point is detected by SIFT and AKAZE algorithm.

3. Circle Fitting
   - Algorithm to detect a circle in any shaped blob containing a circular shape

4. Coordinate Transformation & Calculation
   - Parallel, Rotation, Symmetric Movement, and Unit Transformation in 2D / 3D Image

5. Calculation of plane warpage and flattening
   - Generate 3D coordinate system graph function expression by approximation

6. Code Optimization
   - Data structure analysis, Time Complexity, Parallel programming by using SSE / AVX
  
7. MFC
   - Event & Message Handling
   - Create & Modify UI


[C#]
- Interlocking with C++ dll
- Marshaling
- Create & Modify UI
- Event Handling (Button, Mouse, Keypress, ...)
- Save & Load User Data by Xml file
